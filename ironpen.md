The Prisoner
============

Every day she heard the music as she stared out of the bay window at the world.
The music never changed.

The house was an old style,
but she never thought about the house.
She saw only the world outside,
the world she would never have.
She saw grass and sunshine.
She saw people she would never meet.
And she heard the music that never changed.

Sometimes the music slowed and stopped,
and she dared hope for something different.
Then the great hands picked up her house and wound the key,
and the music started again.

The music never changed.
